# Ice-ages-in-AlphaCen

This is a repository containing processed data and python scripts for the article "XXXXXXXX".  The paper investigates the potential for Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs to host moons.

In the python-scripts folder, there are a number of python files that reproduce the figures in our work.  The python scripts assume a directory tree produced from "git clone \*.git" to find/use the "data" subfolder and produce the associated figure in the "Figs" subfolder.  See the python-scripts folder for more details, but here are summaries of each script and its usage.  

-  plot_FigXX.py
   -  These scripts do not require any line arguments and are called via "python plot_FigXX.py" from an anaconda terminal, where the XX is replace with 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, or 16.


The python scripts use packages from numpy, scipy (>= 1.4), & matplotlib.
